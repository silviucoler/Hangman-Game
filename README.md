# Hangman Game

## Description

This is a Hangman game made with React. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words, and the player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman being drawn. If the player runs out of attempts, the game is over, and the word is revealed. If the player guesses the word correctly, the player wins the game.
